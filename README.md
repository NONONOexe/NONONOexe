### My research interests :telescope:

I am comducting research on artificial intelligence technologies for disaster prevention and traffic safety.

My research topics include:

- Multi-agent systems
- Geospatial analysis
- Traffic safety research
- Development of rescue strategies

I am also involved in a variety of other research projects:

- [RoboCupRescue Simulation](https://rescuesim.robocup.org/)
- [Airtificial Intelligence based Werewolf](https://aiwolf.org/server)

### RoboCupRescue Simulation

I am contributing on research using RoboCupRescue Simulation, a multi-agent simulation focusing on disaster rescue.
In 2024, my team, AIT-Rescue won the world championship in the RoboCupRescue Simulatio agent competition 2024.
I am also developing various tools around the simulation, such as server and agent development frameworks.

- [rcrs-server](https://github.com/roborescue/rcrs-server): The server program for RoboCupRescue Simulation. I have made modifications to tools that convert OSM maps to RoboCupRescue Simulation maps and a visual editor for disaster scenarios.
- [adf-core-java](https://github.com/roborescue/adf-core-java): A Java framework for developing agents in RoboCupRescue Simulation.

### R packages :package:

I develop R packages related to our research.

- [jpaccidents](https://github.com/NONONOexe/jpaccidents): Tools for Traffic Accident Data in Japan
- [rrstools](https://github.com/NONONOexe/rrstools): Tools for Analyzing RoboCupRescue Simulation Data
- [setariaviridis](https://github.com/NONONOexe/setariaviridis): Field-Collected Data of Green Foxtail (This was created for a statistics study group)
- [aichicities](https://github.com/NONONOexe/aichicities): Aichi Prefecture Administrative Area Data in an Easy-to-use Format in R

### Recent Activities :pencil:

Recently, I have been working on writing my doctoral dissertation and organizing events.
